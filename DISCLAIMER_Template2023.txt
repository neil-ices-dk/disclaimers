### ﻿Disclaimer new TXT template 2023
> This is the new version of the ICES Data disclaimer that should be attached to any data download.
> Note 1. In Section 3, make sure to add information with details specific to your project.
> Note 2. Section 4 refers to the generic ICES Data Policy and restricted biodiversity license. Projects with other restricted policies should add their own references instead. Projects with Public data only should change "Data provided from the website are classified as either 'Public' or 'Restricted’." to "Data provided from the website are classified as 'Public'." and remove 2 lines referring to the restricted data licenses
> Note 3. In Section 7, two generic metadata links are listed. In addition, separate projects should include project-specific metadata links, if available.
> Note 4. In Sections 1 and 6, similarly to the current template, some references require project-based adjustments, and some need dynamic download-specific referencing, which is most likely already implemented in the previous disclaimer version.
	Project-specific references are: 'XXX dataset' and 'https://xxxdataset.ices.dk'
	Download-specific references are: 'LAYERNAMEXXX', 'DATETIMEXXX', and 'AcknowledgeXXX'
